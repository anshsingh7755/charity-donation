RESPONSIVE DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

MOBILE-FIRST APPROACH
- Start with mobile design as base
- Add features and spacing for larger screens
- Test on actual devices for accuracy

FLUID SIZING WITH clamp()
Logo font-size: clamp(16px, 5vw, 24px)
- Minimum: 16px (smallest on small phones)
- Preferred: 5% of viewport width (scales with screen)
- Maximum: 24px (largest on big screens)

Navbar padding: clamp(10px, 2vw, 20px)
- Scales padding automatically from 10px to 20px
- No media query needed

Navigation gap: clamp(15px, 3vw, 30px)
- Spacing between nav items automatically adjusts

Icon sizing: clamp(40px, 10vw, 48px)
- Icons scale from 40px to 48px based on viewport

MEDIA QUERIES
@media (max-width: 768px) - Tablet changes
- Adjust font sizes
- Stack grid to single column
- Modify navigation layout

@media (max-width: 480px) - Mobile changes
- Reduce heading sizes
- Stack everything vertically
- Optimize button sizes

FLEXBOX & GRID LAYOUTS
- navigation: Flex for horizontal layout
- causes-grid: Grid with auto-fit for responsive columns
- about-stats: Grid that adjusts column count
- footer-content: Grid with responsive columns

TESTING RESPONSIVE DESIGN
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Click device toggle (Ctrl+Shift+M)
3. Test different device sizes
4. Check that all content is readable
5. Verify no horizontal scrolling on mobile
